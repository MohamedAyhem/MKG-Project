# MKG-Project

This project is a landing page built based on a Figma design provided by MKG Concept. The project uses several technologies to create an elegant interface for the website.

-- PS :*THE PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS*

## Project Overview

The core of the project includes:
- **HTML & CSS**: Structure and styling of the page
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient utility-based styling
- **React**: To manage the interactive parts of the project
- **JavaScript**: Handles various page functionalities
- **Images**: Folder contains all assets used in the design

## What Has Been Completed

- Basic layout and design implemented based on the Figma file.
- Styling applied using Tailwind CSS.
- Core page structure set up with HTML, CSS, and React.

## What Is Pending

- **Responsiveness**: The website is not fully responsive yet. I planned to use media queries and other tools for that.
- **Burger Menu**: A burger menu for mobile devices hasn't been added but was part of the design.

## Reason for Incomplete Features

The project couldn’t be fully completed due to upcoming exams, but I still wanted to submit the current state to show the progress made. 

## Further Opportunities

I am eager to continue working on this and other projects with MGK Consulting. I will be available for internships or further development work in January, and I’m excited to continue collaborating in the future.
